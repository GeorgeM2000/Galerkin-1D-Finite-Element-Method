# Galerkin 1D Finite Element Method
 Finite element Galerkin method for solving one dimentional boundary value problems

## Usage
This method solves one dimentional boundary value problems in the form -p(x)u''(x) = f(x) and -p(x)u''(x) + q(x)u(x) = f(x)
with boundary conditions u(x0) = y0, u(xn) = yn.
